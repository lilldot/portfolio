                    <p><b>I love learning</b>, and get giddily excited about podcasts, Maria Popova's inspiring life lessons, and Atlas Obscura's latest obscure discoveries.</p>
                    <p><b>I love creating and making things</b>. I drool over beautiful illustrations, photos, videos, DIY's, architecture, any form of creative expressions really. I want to learn them all! At the moment, I'm focused on ballet and watercolor!</p>
										<p><b>Laugh, dance, travel, read, live life to the fullest.</b> I don't sleep enough, but I dream.</p>
